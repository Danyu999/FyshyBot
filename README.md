# FyshyBot
A Discord bot that has social and server management features.

My personal project to experiment with creating bots on Discord while learning to multithread, use APIs, and create intuitive/efficient structures to utilize/manage information.

Coded using IntelliJ, Maven, and Discord4J

**IMPORTANT NOTES**
-------------------
In order to make the bot work, you must create your own Config.java file.

Example set up for the Config.java file can be seen in the ConfigExample.java file.

Only change necessary to make the bot work is adding in a token.
