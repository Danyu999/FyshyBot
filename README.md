# FyshyBot
A Discord bot that has social and server management features. Currently, doesn't really do anything.

My personal project to experiment with creating bots for discord.

Coded using IntelliJ, Maven, and Discord4J

**IMPORTANT NOTES**
-------------------
In order to make the bot work, you must create your own Config.java file.

Example set up for the Config.java file can be seen in the ConfigExample.java file.

Only change necessary to make the bot work is adding in a token.
